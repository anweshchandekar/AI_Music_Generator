"# AI Music Generator" 

This model is designed to generate music based on input sequences. It leverages deep learning techniques to create MIDI files, which can be used in various music applications.

Model Details:

* Model Architecture: The model is built using a sequential deep learning architecture that may include layers such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), depending on the specific implementation.

* Training Data: The model was trained on a dataset of MIDI files, which were pre-processed to extract sequences of notes and chords. These sequences were used to train the model to predict the next notes in a sequence.

Output: The model generates music sequences as MIDI files, which can be used in digital audio workstations (DAWs) or other music software for further processing or playback.

Usage
To use this model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:

git clone https://huggingface.co/your-repo-name
cd your-repo-name

2. Load the Model:
In your Python environment, load the pre-trained model:

from keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('AI_Music_Generator.h5')

3. Generate Music:
Add your code to generate music using the model. For example:
# Code to generate music

4. Convert Predictions to MIDI:
The output of the model can be converted into a MIDI file for playback or further processing.

Example
Below is a simple example of how to generate music using the AI Music Generator:

import numpy as np

# Loading pre-trained model
model = load_model('AI_Music_Generator.h5')

# Generate a sequence
sequence = np.random.randint(0, high=number_of_notes, size=(1, sequence_length))

# Predict the next notes
predictions = model.predict(sequence)

# Convert the predictions to MIDI (refer to the conversion script)
convert_to_midi(predictions)
